# BUSINESS PROBLEM:
From past data of user's orders over time we need to predict which products user will Repurchase (reorder) in next order. In this problem we are not recommend new products to the user but we will recommend products to the user that are bought buy user in previous orders. In this problem we have 206209 users and 49688 products so we can not recommend products manually that's why good ML system can solve our problem.
